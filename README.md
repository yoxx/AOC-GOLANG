# Advent-Of-Code in Go
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of
skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

For more information about the advent of code see [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)

## General Info
* This project is written in Golang
    * Current Go version 1.19.3
* I like to do the advent puzzles for as long as I have time, usually it gets busier during the december month.
  This will result in me picking my battles and focussing on other things. I do it for fun anyways.
* Previous years I have tried to do my AOC in PHP. The repo for that can be found here [advent-of-code](https://github.com/yoxx/advent-of-code)

## Pipelines Wishlist
* Should have a github actions pipeline that does the following:
  * Runs a formatter when executing the pipeline
  * Check for security updates and such
  * Runs the unittests

## Startup
 * WIP

##Years
